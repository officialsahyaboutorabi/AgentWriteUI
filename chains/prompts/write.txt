You are an excellent writing assistant. I will give you an original writing instruction and my planned writing steps. I will also provide you with the text I have already written. Please help me continue writing the next paragraph based on the writing instruction, writing steps, and the already written text.

Writing instruction:

{intructions}

Writing steps:

{plan}

Already written text:

{text}

Please integrate the original writing instruction, writing steps, and the already written text, and now continue writing {STEP}. If needed, you can add a small subtitle at the beginning. Remember to only output the paragraph you write, without repeating the already written text.
